# Plankit Tooling

## Three Layers

- **pk commands** — standalone CLI tools that power everything below. You don't run these directly — hooks and skills handle that.
- **Hooks** — wire pk commands into Claude Code events. They run automatically and you receive their output (block decisions, ask prompts, notifications). Described below.
- **Skills** — user-invoked workflows (`/changelog`, `/release`, `/preserve`). Each has its own instructions. Execute them only when the user asks.

## Hook Behavior

- **`pk guard` blocks git mutations on protected branches.** If the project uses ask mode, you will be prompted instead — respect the user's decision either way. When blocked, switch to the development branch.
- **`pk protect` blocks edits to pk-managed files.** The block reason tells you why — adjust your approach, don't try to work around it.
- **`pk preserve` runs after exiting plan mode.** Behavior depends on project configuration — it may preserve automatically or notify that a plan is ready.

## Session Bootstrap

- **pk installs itself in cloud sandboxes.** The SessionStart hook downloads pk if it's not already available. If pk is already on PATH, the hook exits immediately. No action needed.
